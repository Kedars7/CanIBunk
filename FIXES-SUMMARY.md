## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Deploying to Render

### You MUST update your .env file:

**Current (WRONG):**
```env
FRONTEND_URL = https://canibunk.onrender.com  ❌ This is the BACKEND URL!
```

**Should be:**
```env
FRONTEND_URL = https://your-app-name.netlify.app  ✅ Your FRONTEND URL!
```

### Deployment Sequence:
1. Deploy backend to Render (FRONTEND_URL will be temporarily wrong - that's OK)
2. Deploy frontend to Netlify
3. **Copy your Netlify URL**
4. Go back to Render → Environment Variables
5. Update FRONTEND_URL to your Netlify URL
6. Render will auto-redeploy with correct CORS

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

## 💡 Pro Tips:

- Keep your local .env file with localhost URLs for development
- Use `npm run dev` for local development (uses nodemon)
- Use `npm start` for production (uses node)
- Monitor Render logs for any deployment issues
- Render free tier has cold starts (~30s after 15min inactivity)
